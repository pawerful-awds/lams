### Tech stack
- Turborepo: It simplifies managing multiple projects within a single repository. It leverages caching and parallel processing to significantly speed up build times. It allows you to share configurations, scripts, and utility functions across multiple projects
- Redux, RTK: Simplifies state management with a structured and predictable state container.
- React Router v6: Provides powerful and flexible routing for single-page applications.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Workbox: Enables advanced caching and offline capabilities for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
- Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- GraphQL: Allows clients to request only the data they need, making APIs more efficient.
- Firebase: Provides real-time database and file storage with easy integration and scalability.
- Framer Motion: A production-ready motion library for React to create animations.
- LocalStorage: Provides local caching of data
