# LAMS
## ðŸš€ Animation Management System (Lottie) - Technical Test

### Overview
The Lottie Animation Management System (LAMS) is a web application that allows users to fetch, preview, upload, and download Lottie animations. The application provides robust offline capabilities, allowing users to interact with animations and access animation details even when no internet connection is available.

### Tech stack
- Turborepo: It simplifies managing multiple projects within a single repository. It leverages caching and parallel processing to significantly speed up build times. It allows you to share configurations, scripts, and utility functions across multiple projects
- Redux, RTK: Simplifies state management with a structured and predictable state container.
- React Router v6: Provides powerful and flexible routing for single-page applications.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Workbox: Enables advanced caching and offline capabilities for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
- Express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- GraphQL: Allows clients to request only the data they need, making APIs more efficient.
- Firebase: Provides real-time database and file storage with easy integration and scalability.
- Framer Motion: A production-ready motion library for React to create animations.
- LocalStorage: Provides local caching of data
